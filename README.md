I am currently a graduate student making the career transition to data analytics from accounting, where I worked in the marketing field. I have always enjoyed working with numbers and problem-solving, which has led me to explore the world of data. I am seeking an entry level data analytics position in either finance or healthcare. I am excited to use data analysis and predictive modeling to uncover insights and help businesses make smarter decisions. I am eager to bring my analytical skills into my new career and see where it takes me!
