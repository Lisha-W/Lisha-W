## Hi there, my name is AliciaðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student making the shift from a career in accounting, where I worked in the marketing field, to data analytics. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working with numbers and problem-solving, which has led me to explore the world of data. Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on financial and healthcare data analytics, and Iâ€™m excited to use data to uncover insights and help businesses make smarter decisions. Iâ€™m eager to bring my analytical skills into this new field and see where it takes me!
